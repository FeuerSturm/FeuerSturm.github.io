A feature update to the Days of War, Battalion 1944 and Vanguard Banner Generator
websites has been deployed!
<!--more-->

**Changes:**
- added "live" Gameserver List to easily select your gameserver for generating
your banner. No need to know the IP/port.
This feature is to be considered experimental, but should be working as expected in general.
My webserver is caching the server list locally and updates it every 5 minutes, so it's only
"close to live".
